# Chapter 1

- Correlation only captures the strength of linear dependence
- Idea: If we can transform & compare in terms of similar underlying marginal dfs, then that would be on fairer grounds.
    - to standard uniform distribution (probability (integral) transformation): $X \sim F \implies F(X) \sim U(0, 1)$
    - to distribution $F: U \sim U(0, 1)$ & $F$ be any df, then $F^{-1}(U) \sim F$ (quantile transformation)

- **Copula:** informal notion of dependence (multivariate df with standard uniform univariate margins). 
    - $(X_1, X_2)$ and $(Y_1, Y_2)$ have same dependence $\approx$ have same copula.
    - requirement of standard uniform is somewhat arbitrary
